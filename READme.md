## Expected Behaviour

2. Important tasks/events can be entered into their daily planner 
3. Time is color coded based on present, past or future 
4. When the save button is clicked, the event is saved in local storage 
5. When the user comes back to the planner later in the day or refreshes the page, the event is still visible.
